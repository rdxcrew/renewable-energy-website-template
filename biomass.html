      <section class="benefits">
        <h2>Benefits of Biomass Resources</h2>
        <p>Biomass resources offer a sustainable and versatile source of energy. By utilizing organic materials such as agricultural residues, wood waste, and municipal solid waste, we can generate electricity, heat, and transportation fuels. Biomass energy helps reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, mitigating climate change and air pollution. Additionally, it can contribute to waste reduction by converting organic waste into valuable energy.

            Beyond environmental benefits, biomass energy also offers economic advantages. It can create jobs in rural areas, stimulate local economies, and reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels. Moreover, biomass-based fuels can be used in existing infrastructure, making the transition to a more sustainable energy system more feasible.</p>

      <section class="installation">
        <h2>Biomass Resources Installation Process</h2>
        <p>The installation process for biomass energy systems varies depending on the specific technology used. For direct combustion systems, such as biomass boilers or furnaces, the process involves setting up the combustion chamber, fuel storage, and flue gas cleaning systems. The biomass fuel, whether it's wood chips, agricultural residues, or other organic materials, is fed into the combustion chamber, where it is burned to produce heat or steam. This heat or steam can then be used to generate electricity or provide heating for buildings.

            For more advanced technologies like gasification or anaerobic digestion, the process is more complex. Gasification involves converting biomass into a combustible gas, while anaerobic digestion breaks down organic matter into biogas. These technologies require specialized equipment and infrastructure, including gasifiers, digesters, and gas cleaning systems. The generated gas can be used to fuel engines or turbines to produce electricity or heat.</p>

      <section class="cost">
        <h2>Installation Cost in INR</h2>
        <p>The cost of installing a biomass energy system in India can vary significantly based on several factors, including the size of the plant, the type of technology used, and the specific requirements of the project. However, a rough estimate for a small-scale biomass power plant can range from ₹5 to ₹10 crore.</p>
