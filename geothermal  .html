      <section class="benefits">
        <h2>Benefits of Geothermal Resources</h2>
        <p>Geothermal resources offer a clean and sustainable source of energy. Unlike fossil fuels, geothermal energy harnesses the Earth's natural heat, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on non-renewable sources. This renewable energy is reliable, available 24/7, and has a minimal environmental impact.

            Beyond electricity generation, geothermal energy has diverse applications. It can be used for heating and cooling buildings, providing efficient and cost-effective solutions for climate control. Additionally, geothermal water can be used in various industries, such as agriculture and aquaculture, offering sustainable alternatives for irrigation and fish farming.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="installation">
        <h2>Geothermal Resources Installation Process</h2>
        <p>The installation process for a geothermal system typically involves several steps. First, a network of pipes, known as a ground loop, is installed underground. This can be done either horizontally by trenching or vertically by drilling deep wells. The depth and configuration of the loop depend on factors such as local geology and the specific needs of the building.

            Once the ground loop is in place, a heat pump is installed indoors. This heat pump acts as the heart of the system, transferring heat between the ground loop and the building. In winter, it extracts heat from the ground and delivers it to the building for heating. In summer, it reverses the process, removing heat from the building and transferring it to the ground for cooling.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="cost">
        <h2>Installation Cost in INR</h2>
        <p>The cost of installing a geothermal system can vary significantly depending on several factors, including the size of the system, the depth of the ground loop, local geological conditions, and labor costs.

            However, a rough estimate for a residential geothermal system in India can range from ₹10 to ₹20 lakhs.</p>
