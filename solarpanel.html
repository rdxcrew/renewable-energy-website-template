        <h2>Benefits of Solar Panels</h2>
        <p>Solar panels have emerged as a powerful tool in our pursuit of a sustainable future. By harnessing the sun's abundant energy, these photovoltaic systems generate clean electricity, reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating climate change. This clean energy source helps preserve our planet's natural resources, protects delicate ecosystems, and improves air quality.

            Beyond environmental benefits, solar panels offer significant economic advantages. By generating electricity on-site, homeowners and businesses can lower their energy bills and reduce their exposure to fluctuating energy prices. Additionally, solar installations can increase property values, making them a wise investment. The solar industry itself creates jobs and drives economic growth, contributing to a thriving and sustainable economy.</p>

      <section class="installation">
        <h2>Solar Panel Installation Process</h2>
        <p>The solar panel installation process begins with a site assessment to determine the optimal location and size of the system. This involves considering factors like roof orientation, shading, and energy consumption. Once the assessment is complete, necessary permits and approvals are obtained from local authorities.

            A sturdy mounting system is then installed on the roof to securely hold the solar panels. The panels are carefully placed on the mounting system and connected to each other using electrical wiring. A solar inverter converts the direct current (DC) electricity generated by the panels into alternating current (AC) electricity, which can be used by household appliances. The inverter is connected to the home's electrical panel, allowing the solar energy to power the home.   
            
            After installation, the system is thoroughly tested to ensure it is functioning correctly. Once commissioned, the system requires minimal maintenance, but regular monitoring can help identify and address any issues.</p>

      <section class="cost">
        <h2>Installation Cost in INR</h2>
        <p>The cost of solar panel installation in India can vary depending on factors such as system size, location, and incentives. On average, the cost can range from ₹50,000 to ₹1,00,000 per kW.</p>
