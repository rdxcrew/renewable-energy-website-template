      <h1>Tidal Energy - Renewable Energy Solutions</h1>

      <section class="benefits">
        <h2>Benefits of Tidal Energy</h2>
        <p>Tidal energy offers a clean and sustainable source of electricity. By harnessing the kinetic energy of ocean tides, tidal power plants generate electricity without producing greenhouse gas emissions or other pollutants. This makes it an environmentally friendly alternative to fossil fuel-based power generation. Additionally, tidal energy is a reliable and predictable source of power, as tides are governed by the predictable gravitational forces of the moon and sun. This predictability allows for efficient planning and integration into the electrical grid.

            Beyond its environmental and operational benefits, tidal energy can contribute to economic development and job creation. The construction and operation of tidal power plants require significant investment and skilled labor, stimulating local economies. Furthermore, tidal energy can enhance coastal protection by reducing the impact of erosion and storm surges. By strategically locating tidal power plants, coastal communities can benefit from both energy generation and improved coastal resilience.</p>

      <section class="installation">
        <h2>Tidal Energy Installation Process</h2>
        <p>The installation process for tidal energy systems varies depending on the specific technology used. One common method involves constructing a barrage across a tidal estuary. This large dam-like structure creates a tidal lagoon, trapping water during high tide. As the tide recedes, the water is released through turbines embedded within the barrage, generating electricity.

            Another approach utilizes tidal stream technology. In this case, underwater turbines are placed in areas with strong tidal currents. These turbines, similar to underwater wind turbines, harness the kinetic energy of the flowing water to generate electricity. The turbines can be fixed to the seabed or mounted on floating platforms, depending on the water depth and current strength.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="cost">
        <h2>Installation Cost in INR</h2>
        <p>The cost of installing a tidal energy system in India can range from ₹30 crore to ₹60 crore per MW.</p>
