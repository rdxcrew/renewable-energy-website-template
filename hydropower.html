        <h2>Benefits of Hydropower Plants</h2>
        <p>Hydropower plants offer a clean and renewable source of energy. By harnessing the kinetic energy of flowing water, these plants generate electricity without producing greenhouse gas emissions or other pollutants. This makes hydropower a crucial component of sustainable energy strategies, helping to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate climate change. Additionally, hydropower plants can provide a reliable and consistent source of electricity, as water flow in rivers and streams is relatively predictable. This allows for efficient planning and integration into the electrical grid.

            Beyond electricity generation, hydropower plants offer additional benefits. The reservoirs created by dams can provide water for irrigation, supporting agriculture and ensuring food security. They can also help regulate water flow, mitigating floods and droughts. Furthermore, hydropower plants can contribute to economic development by creating jobs and stimulating local economies. The construction and operation of these plants require significant investment and skilled labor, benefiting communities in the surrounding areas.</p>

      <section class="installation">
        <h2>Hydropower Plants Installation Process</h2>
        <p>The installation process of a hydropower plant typically involves several stages. First, a suitable site with a significant water flow and sufficient elevation difference is identified. This site is then assessed for its feasibility, considering factors like environmental impact, geological conditions, and economic viability. Once a suitable site is selected, a dam is constructed to create a reservoir, storing water at a higher elevation.

            The stored water is then released through a penstock, a large pipe that carries the water to a turbine. The kinetic energy of the falling water spins the turbine, which in turn drives a generator to produce electricity. The generated electricity is then transmitted to the power grid through transmission lines, supplying power to homes and industries.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="cost">
        <h2>Installation Cost in INR</h2>
        <p>The cost of installing a hydropower plant in India can vary significantly based on factors like project size, location, and specific technology. However, a rough estimate for a small hydropower project (up to 25 MW) can range from ₹7 crore to ₹12 crore per MW. Larger hydropower projects can cost even more, with estimates ranging from ₹6 crore to ₹10 crore per MW.
