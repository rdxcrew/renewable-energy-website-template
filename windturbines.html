        <h2>Benefits of Wind Turbines</h2>
        <p>Wind turbines harness the power of the wind to generate clean, renewable energy. This renewable energy source offers numerous environmental and economic benefits. By utilizing wind power, we can significantly reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, thereby lowering greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change. Wind energy is a clean and sustainable source of electricity, producing no air pollution or harmful byproducts.

            Beyond environmental benefits, wind power also offers economic advantages. The wind energy industry creates jobs in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance, stimulating economic growth. As technology advances, the cost of wind energy continues to decline, making it a competitive energy source. Additionally, wind farms can generate significant revenue for local communities through property taxes and lease payments, contributing to economic development and infrastructure improvements.</p>

      <section class="installation">
        <h2>Wind Turbines Installation Process</h2>
        <p>The installation of a wind turbine is a complex process that requires careful planning and execution. The first step involves a thorough site assessment to determine the wind speed and direction, as well as the suitability of the land for construction. Once a suitable location is identified, the foundation for the turbine is constructed, which typically involves digging a deep hole and pouring concrete.   

            The next step is the erection of the turbine tower. This is a massive undertaking that often requires specialized equipment, such as cranes. Once the tower is erected, the nacelle, which houses the turbine's generator and other components, is hoisted into place. Finally, the turbine blades are attached to the nacelle.   
            
            After the physical installation, electrical connections are made to the grid, ensuring that the generated electricity can be transmitted to homes and businesses.
            
             The entire system is then thoroughly tested to ensure its proper functioning and safety. </p>

      <section class="cost">
        <h2>Installation Cost in INR</h2>
        <p>The cost of installing a wind turbine in India can vary significantly based on several factors, including the turbine's capacity, location, and specific project requirements. However, a rough estimate for a typical onshore wind turbine project can range from ₹5 to ₹5.5 crore per MW.</p>
